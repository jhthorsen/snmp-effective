NAME
    SNMP::Effective - An effective SNMP-information-gathering module

VERSION
    This document refers to version 0.04 of SNMP::Effective.

SYNOPSIS
     use SNMP::Effective;
 
     my $snmp = SNMP::Effective->new(
         MaxSessions   => $NUM_POLLERS,
         MasterTimeout => $TIMEOUT_SECONDS,
     );
 
     $snmp->add(
         DestHost => $ip,
         Callback => sub { store_data() },
         get      => [ '1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0', 'sysDescr' ],
     );
     # lather, rinse, repeat
 
     # retrieve data from all hosts
     $snmp->execute;

DESCRIPTION
    This module collects information, over SNMP, from many hosts and many
    OIDs, really fast.

    It is a wrapper around the facilities of "SNMP.pm", which is the Perl
    interface to the C libraries in the "SNMP" package. Advantages of using
    this module include:

    Simple configuration
        The data structures required by "SNMP" are complex to set up before
        polling, and parse for results afterwards. This module provides a
        simpler interface to that configuration by accepting just a list of
        SNMP OIDs or leaf names.

    Parallel execution
        Many users are not aware that "SNMP" can poll devices asynchronously
        using a callback system. By specifying your callback routine as in
        the "SYNOPSIS" section above, many network devices can be polled in
        parallel, making operations far quicker. Note that this does not use
        threads.

    It's fast
        To give one example, "SNMP::Effective" can walk, say, eight indexed
        OIDs (port status, errors, traffic, etc) for around 300 devices
        (that's 8500 ports) in under 30 seconds. Storage of that data might
        take an additional 10 seconds (depending on whether it's to RAM or
        disk). This makes polling/monitoring your network every five minutes
        (or less) no problem at all.

    The interface to this module is simple, with few options. The sections
    below detail everything you need to know.

METHODS
  "new"
    This is the object constructor, and returns an SNMP::Effective object.

    Arguments: (can be called many ways: DestHost, destHOst, dest_host)

     MaxSessions   => int # maximum number of simultaneous SNMP sessions
     MasterTimeout => int # maximum number of seconds before killing execute

    All other arguments are passed on to $snmp_effective->add( ... ).

  "add"
    Adding information about what SNMP data to get and where to get it.

    Arguments: (can be called many ways: DestHost, destHOst, dest_host)

     DestHost => []       # array-ref that contains a list of hosts
                          # either ip-address or hostname
     Arg      => {}       # hash-ref, that is passed on to SNMP::Session
     Callback => sub {}   # the callback which handles the response
     Heap     => ANYTHING # placeholder for extra information
     get      => []       # array-ref that holds a list of OIDs to get
     getnext  => []       # array-ref that holds a list of OIDs to getnext
     walk     => []       # array-ref that holds a list of OIDs to walk
     set      => []       # array-ref that holds a list of OIDs to set + values

    This can be called with many different combinations, such as:

    DestHost / any other argument
        This will make changes per DestHost specified. You can use this to
        change Arg, Callback or add OIDs on a per-host basis.

    get / getnext / walk / set
        The OID list submitted to "add()" will be added to all DestHosts, if
        no DestHost is specified.

    Arg / Callback
        This can be used to alter all hosts' SNMP arguments or callback
        method.

  "execute"
    This method starts setting and/or getting data. It will run as long as
    necessary, or until MasterTimeout seconds has passed. Every time some
    data is set and/or retrieved, it will call the callback-method, as
    defined globally or per host.

  "master_timeout"
     Get/Set the master timeout

  "max_sessions"
     Get/Set the number of max session

  "log"
    This returns the Log4perl object that is used for logging:

     $self->log->warn("log this message!");

  "hostlist"
     Returns a list containing all the hosts.

  "arg"
     Returns a hash with the default args

  "callback"
     Returns a ref to the default callback sub-routine.

FUNCTIONS
  "make_name_oid"
    Takes a list of numeric OIDs and turns them into an mib-object string.

     make_name_oid("1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1"); # return sysDescr

  "make_numeric_oid"
    Inverse of make_numeric_oid: Takes a list of mib-object strings, and
    turns them into numeric format.

     make_numeric_oid("sysDescr"); # return .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1 

  "match_oid"
    Takes two arguments: One OID to match against, and the OID to match.

     match_oid("1.3.6.10",   "1.3.6");    # return 10
     match_oid("1.3.6.10.1", "1.3.6");    # return 10.1
     match_oid("1.3.6.10",   "1.3.6.11"); # return undef

The callback method
    When "SNMP" is done collecting data from a host, it calls a callback
    method, provided by the "Callback => sub{}" argument. Here is an example
    of a callback method:

     sub my_callback {
         my($host, $error) = @_
  
         if($error) {
             warn "$host failed with this error: $error"
             return;
         }
 
         my $data = $host->data;
 
         for my $oid (keys %$data) {
             print "$host returned oid $oid with this data:\n";
 
             print join "\n\t",
                   map { "$_ => $data->{$oid}{$_}" }
                       keys %{ $data->{$oid}{$_} };
             print "\n";
         }
     }

DEBUGGING
    Debugging is enabled through Log::Log4perl. If nothing else is
    spesified, it will default to "error" level, and print to STDERR. The
    component-name you want to change is "SNMP::Effective", inless this
    module ins inherited.

NOTES
    walk
        SNMP::Effective doesn't really do a SNMP native "walk". It makes a
        series of "getnext", which is almost the same as SNMP's walk.

    set Example on how to use SNMP::Effective for snmp-set:

         $effective->add(
            set => [
                [$oid,$value,$type], # shorthand for SNMP::Effective, safe
                [$oid,$value],       # even shorter for SNMP::Effective, not safe
                $SNMP_Varbind_obj,
                $SNMP_VarList_obj,
            ]
         );

        The first is a bit shorter than what you usually give SNMP::Varbind,
        since you ommit the IID (second argument).

        The second way, is not safe in the sense that it will try to guess
        which type the value is. Only INTEGER and IPADDR is supported for
        now, and if it doesn't match any of them, it falls back on OCTETSTR.

TODO
    Improve debugging support

DEPENDENCIES
    In addition to the contents of the standard Perl distribution, this
    module requires the following:

        Note that this is not the same as "Net::SNMP" on the CPAN. You want
        the "SNMP" CPAN distribution or the "SNMP" distribution.
